> Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.

### Level 1 is required.

### Level 2 and 3 are optional.

# Level 1 Process (Required)

## Customer pages

### Home page

The home page must include:

- A hero banner with an image that is uploaded to Strapi.
- A list of featured products.
  - In Strapi each product must have a featured flag that can be turned on or off. When the flag is on, the product shall be displayed on the homepage.

### Products page

The products page must include:

- A list of all products added to Strapi. Each product must display its title, price and image. The product shall link to its products detail page.
- A search text box. When searching, the products that include the searched text in their **title** or **description** shall be listed.

### Product details page

The product details page must include:

- the product title,
- the product description,
- the product image,
- the product’s price,
- an add to cart button.

### Cart/Basket page

The cart/basket page must display a list of all products added to cart. Load the items that have been added to local storage and display them on the page.

Each product in the cart must display:

- the product title,
- the product’s price,
- a link to the product view page, and optionally display the product image,

After the list of products, display the total price of all the products in the cart.

> **Important:** the cart page is not a checkout page. No payments or user details are required to be taken.

## Admin section

The admin section must include the following features.

### Login/Logout

Create an admin login form that allows administrator users to login.

- Use localStorage to keep the user logged in.
- When logged in, display a logout button in the layout the logs the user out.
- Logging out should not clear items not related to login from localStorage.

### Add/edit products

Create form(s) that allow products to be added and edited. The form must allow the user to toggle whether a product is featured.

#### Product images

For adding/editing product images use either of these 2 methods:

1. Use a file upload field to upload images to Strapi, or
2. Use a text input that allows a URL to be entered. This allows an image from CDN to be used as the product image.

### Delete existing product

Allow products to be deleted. Before a product is deleted you must display a confirmation. The product should only be deleted if the user confirms. If the user cancels, the product must not be deleted.

## Level 2

- Category filters & price filter (on product list page)
- Product page image gallery

## Level 3

- Customer Registration
- Customers must not have access to admin section
- Customers will be able to create a list of favourites products

# Rules

- The website must be responsive on all devices.
- Use vanilla (regular) JavaScript for the project and split your code up using modules (imports/exports).
- No JavaScript frameworks (Vue.Js, React.js).
- You can use small JS libraries to perform tasks such as formatting dates with Moment.js
- You may choose a CSS framework but your design must override the basic framework styles. Your UI must appear indistinguishable from the framework base styles.
- Data must be updated from the pages and API calls you create. You are not allowed to edit the API content through the front end of the strapi admin website found at http://localhost:1337/.
- Copying and sharing of any code will result in your project being failed.

# Marking criteria

- All functionality in Level 1 should be implemented.
- The design should be coherent and provide a good user experience.
- All the customer-facing and admin pages must be fully responsive.
- Use appropriate names for Sass classes and folders.
- All code should be properly formatted and arranged with sensible variable and function names. Use modules (imports/exports) to organise your code.
